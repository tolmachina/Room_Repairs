/*Debug the program so that it executes correctly.
**This program calculates floor or wall surface areas

**It asks a user to enter their name, phone, address
**Then enter the room they wish to remodel
**The user is asked to select a task
**then a material.
**The program will generate an estimate of
**the cost of the project.

**The user inputs are in the input.txt file.*/
